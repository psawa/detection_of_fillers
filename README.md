# Detection of fillers in conversational speech

This work is a NLP master's degree project aiming at improving ASR systems, in particular in the specific task of detecting fillers in spontaneous speech. 

Fillers are a specific type of disfluencies. Disfluencies can be defined as interruptions in normal flow of speech which make utterances longer without adding semantic information. Fillers, in particular, are vocalizations, like “uhm”, “eh”, “ah” etc., which fill the time that should be occupied by a word (generally in correspondence of hesitations, uncertainty or attempts to hold the floor).
